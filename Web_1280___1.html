<span>If network is a container, then design is water in it <br/>likewise. As a media, the form of network is determined <br/>by science and technology. The birth of 4G has driven <br/>the network to an unprecedented peak of development <br/>– Social Network Services, live webcast, AI technology <br/>and other emerging industries are born along with the <br/>improvement of science and technology. As 5G <br/>technology is expected to enter service in the next few <br/>years, which means not only the acceleration of network <br/>speed, but the possibility of change of network from 2D <br/>space to 3D space as well. With the constant change of <br/>the “container”, the design will change its role inside <br/>freely, but its significance can’t be ignored. If the <br/>meaning of the existence of design is to disseminate <br/>information, then I believe, with the help of science and <br/>technology, artists will create more brilliant art forms. <br/>Let’s enjoy ourselves by that time.</span>
